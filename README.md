# The Molasses Engine
**By Tyler Royer**

Yeah, it's called molasses because it's slow.  Because its Java.  But I couldn't find a good enough
2D game engine for Java so I made one.  It's very minimal at the moment and definately not stable.
It's not really meant to be used at this stage by anyone but myself, but it you wanna use it, knock
yourself out.  Just give me credit in your game somewhere.   

In addition, if you do use the engine and would like to say thanks, I'll take donations
[here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=28W649DC5K322&currency_code=USD&source=url)!
I really do appreciate any donations, no matter how small :D
